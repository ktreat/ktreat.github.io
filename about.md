This page describes what this blog is all about and about its authors.

### **About the authors:**

#### **Tapan Anand**

My name is Tapan Anand and I am currently working at Adobe Systems, Noida as a Developer. I pursued my B. Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering at MNNIT, Allahabad. I am the founding author of Ktreat. I am a not so nerdy geek who has great interest in learning about computers &#8211; learning different technologies, how different technologies work, etc. This Blog is an effort from me to share the knowledge I gain about computer science with all of you. I&#8217;ll try to be as regular as possible.

#### **Saurabh Singhal**

Hi! I am Saurabh Singhal. I am pursuing B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering at MNNIT, Allahabad. I joined Ktreat some time after its inception. As someone who likes to learn something all the time, I thought of joining Ktreat to share whatsoever little I have learned. I&#8217;ll try to be comprehensive in my posts.

&nbsp;

Ktreat is here to give you knowledge beyond Placement. It&#8217;s more about interest than learning things for placement and other forced reasons.

#### **Q1. Will I gain Knowledge here?**

**Ans.** Of course you will after all it&#8217;s Ktreat &#8211; **&#8220;K&#8221;** for **Knowledge**.

#### **Q2. What kind of knowledge will I gain?**

**Ans.Â **Knowledge related to Computer Science but not limited to any particular field of it.

#### **Q3. Why Beyond Placement?**

**Ans.** It&#8217;s not like this blog will be anti-placement. In fact everything you read here will increase your chances of getting placed in a very good company. What I mean by _Beyond Placement_ is that I want to share my ever unsatisfied hunger for knowledge about computers and want you to learn things not for placement purposes only but for learning itself.

#### **Q4. How can I stay in touch?**
