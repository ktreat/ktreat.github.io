It is that time of the year when the whole world is held in awe by the new technologies being introduced at the **<a title="Home - 2015 International CES" href="http://www.cesweb.org/" target="_blank">CES (Consumer Electronics Show)</a>** held at Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S from January 6 to January 9 2015.

**International CES**, more commonly known as the **Consumer Electronics Show** (**CES**), is an internationally renowned electronics and technology trade show, attracting major companies and industry professionals worldwide. The annual show is held each January at the Las Vegas Convention Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States.

CES hosts previews and announcements of various cool products and gadgets which define the future of our technology and life. Since its inception in 1967 various major technologies like VCR, CD, DVD, HDTV, Blu-Ray, etc have debuted at CES.

This year&#8217;s CES isn&#8217;t behind in any terms. We have seen a new and improved Hydrogen fueled Car from Toyota. A $6000 Smartphone from Lamborghini. Driverless cars from Mercedes and Audi. A new processor called Broadwell from intel, etc

Now, there is a reason why I have combined this post about CES with the next installment of Webmarks. If you are to follow CES and its technologies, you either watch the long and boring presentations (which by the way are not available publicly), or you simply hear the best out of these presentations from the best tech geeks. To me the second option looks more compelling.

So, our webmark for today is¬† a website that covers CES in quite a lot detail, with regular updation. But this website has a lot more to it than just CES. Here is the link:

### <a title="Revision3" href="http://revision3.com" target="_blank">Revision3</a>

It is a website or more like a podcast which features various kinds of shows ranging from technology to life hacks. In their own words:

> We create and produce all-original weekly and daily episodic community driven programs watched by a super committed, passionate fan base

And one very important thing about this website is that all videos are 100% HD and free üôÇ .

Every year Revision3 covers CES in quite a lot detail. Each show tries to cover various aspects of the CES and the shows are really awesome üôÇ .

Now, you can choose which shows to watch from its current shows as well as the archived ones. The archive has some really awesome shows that should not have ended üôÅ . You can login and subscribe for regular updates when a new video is added in your favorite show.

Here are a few shows that I recommend:

  1. <a title="Android Authority" href="http://revision3.com/androidauthority/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> &#8211; Android news/reviews.
  2. <a title="Techno Buffalo" href="http://revision3.com/technobuffalo/" target="_blank">Techno Buffalo</a> &#8211; Tech news/reviews/rumours.
  3. <a title="Hak5" href="http://revision3.com/hak5/" target="_blank">Hak5</a> &#8211; Hacking, Open Source, etc &#8211; Really Awesome
  4. <a title="HakTip" href="http://revision3.com/haktip/" target="_blank">HakTip</a>
  5. <a title="Tekzilla" href="http://revision3.com/tekzilla/" target="_blank">Tekzilla</a> &#8211; Feeds your tech hunger &#8211; Awesome
  6. <a title="Tekzilla Daily Tip" href="http://revision3.com/tzdaily/" target="_blank">Tekzilla Daily Tip</a> &#8211; Archived, but one of the best
  7. <a title="GeekBeat.TV" href="http://revision3.com/geekbeattv/" target="_blank">GeekBeat.TV</a>
  8. <a title="OS.ALT" href="http://revision3.com/osalt/" target="_blank">OS.ALT</a> &#8211; Archived but really good content
  9. <a title="LifeHacker" href="http://revision3.com/lifehacker/" target="_blank">LifeHacker</a> &#8211; A very well known channel &#8211; Archived sadly üôÅ
 10. <a title="ThreatWire" href="http://revision3.com/threatwire/" target="_blank">ThreatWire</a> &#8211; Archived Security, Privacy and Internet freedom

There was one another show that I can&#8217;t find in the archives but was really cool. It was called ScamSchool. It is now hosted on a new website by the same Discovery network call <a title="Test Tube" href="http://testtube.com" target="_blank">testtube.com</a> and the link for the show Scam School is <a title="Scam School" href="http://testtube.com/scamschool/" target="_blank">here</a>.
