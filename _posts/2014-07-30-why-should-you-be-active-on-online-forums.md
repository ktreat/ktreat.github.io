So here I am with the first post of my blog and see what it&#8217;s about &#8211; **Online Forums** üòê . And I say they are a great place to **share knowledge**. But they are not just that. They are an even better place to **gain knowledge from others**. You will **work on real problems faced by others** and if you are serious enough you will **think about them as if the problem is yours**. Thus, you will **improve your problem solving skills** and in the process help others.

Although I am also quite new to using forums, but I have learned a lot in this short span. I have **searched for things on Google that I would have never expected me to**. What problems others face may not be faced by you, so when you try to solve others&#8217; problems you have to know about a few things that you don&#8217;t. One thing that helps a lot in this situation is the **points/credits/reputation system**.

The **credit system** just pushes you further to try to Google the slight doubt that you have or a few terminologies you are unclear of or an algorithm you are unaware of. And after you have nailed the unknown you jump up to answer the question. Now, this is where you improve on another thing &#8211; **writing and explaining skills**.

You can gain all the knowledge you want but it is nothing until you can **express it**. Explaining the solution to someone gives you practice in this field. Forums also teach you how to **appreciate or criticize others&#8217; work** by the vote up/down facility. Forums also teach you how to work in a team.

Plus don&#8217;t forget about getting those headbanging problems and doubts. You can ask for help on them from others. This part is the one that really helps you with your knowledge and experience. Sometimes you get answers or suggestions you had never thought of. So, in a gist &#8211; **Forums are the place to go to &#8211; _test, practice, gain and express knowledge_**.

So, having consumed all these words üôÇ I would like to suggest a few Computer Forums to follow:

  1. [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) &#8211; The best there was, the best there is, can&#8217;t say about the future though üòõ
  2. [DaniWeb](http://www.daniweb.com/) &#8211; Very Good for beginners.
  3. [Bytes](http://www.bytes.com/) &#8211; Very good answers.
  4. [DreaminCode](http://www.dreamincode.net/) &#8211; Very good answers.

Please [comment](http://ktreat.com/?p=22#respond), if I missed any good one.

**A Note on Using Forums:¬†**Before going on to use a forum I&#8217;d suggest you read their FAQ section carefully to use it more efficiently.

Will return soon with my next post. Till then, please comment if you have any suggestions, criticism, appreciation, etc.
